	 @details 		In most cases, this is the most utilized class in the node-tree.
	 				
	 				Sprites only support the PNG format (0.9).
	 
	 				If you intend to reuse the same texture at several places,
	 				consider loading the texture once via a SpriteBatchNode, 
	 				and call @e UseBatchNode on your relevant Sprite objects.
	 				
	 				Note that if you're using a sprite sheet, you may want to
	 				set the clipping-rectangle (the @e rect attribute) to 
	 				fit the frame you want from your sheet.
	 
	 				The coordinate system used in textures is as general in Pim:
	 				[0,0] is in the bottom left corner, [w,h] is in the top right
	 				corner.
