	 @brief  	The foundational class of Pim.
	 
	 @details 	GameControl handles input via SDL, is in charge of executing
	 			the game-loop and is in general a friendly boss.
	 			
	 			The GameControl singleton should be created within the main()
	 			function of your app. The "Go()" method is never returned 
	 			from until the Pim-window is closed, under any circumstances.
	 
	 			Direct interaction with the GameControl singleton is sometimes 
	 			needed, but mostly for administrative purposes like limiting
	 			the framerate or pausing the game.

	 			You can provide GameControl with a pause-layer by overriding the
	 			"virtual Layer* PauseLayer()" method in your Scene-classes. The 
	 			unoverriden method returns NULL, and if NULL is returned, the 
	 			game is @b NOT paused.
	 
	 			All children of the provided pause-layer receives all possible
	 			update calls as long as the game is paused.
	
	 			The pause layer is deleted automatically upon resuming the game.
				
	 			When pausing the game, the currently active scene is paused,
				and does not receive input updates or frame updates. 
	 
	 			Example:
	 @code
	 			// Somewhere in your code:
	 			GameControl::GetSingleton()->Pause();
	 
	 			// In your Scene class:
	 			Layer* MyScene::PauseLayer() {
	 				return new MyCustomPauseLayer();

	 @details	Objects notify the GameControl object whenever one of their children
	 			has been scheduled for deletion via @e RemoveChild(). In order to
	 			prevent crashes from Actions and other scheduled events, the objects
	 			must be deleted when no outer loop or object is depending on that
	 			specific object to be alive.
				
	 			This method is called at several points during the game-loop, so
	 			delete-queue objects are rarely alive for more than a few milliseconds
	 			after they have been removed from their parent.
